Hello! Iâ€™m Katie. In 2006 I was diagnosed with Restless Legs Syndrome and Iâ€™ve been tossing and turning ever since ðŸ˜‰. 

Working in the healthcare industry, Iâ€™ve searched for explanations and/or treatments and longed for answers to this diagnosis that was quite literally keeping me up at night (note: **I am not a doctor**, and I cannot give medical advice).

Dealing with the symptoms of RLS is a journey and one that I hope you will join me on!

My partner bringing these posts to your screen is Vinny. Heâ€™s a talented software engineer (lucky me, hey?) who puts up with the crankiness and mood swings my sleepless nights can bring.

Hopefully together we can build a *Well Rested* community!
