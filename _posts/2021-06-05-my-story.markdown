excerpt: "A little about me and my history with RLS"
---
In 2006 I was working in the fitness/healthcare world as a Kinesiologist when I got word that I had not been accepted to the Physiotherapy program I had applied to. As an early 20-something, I hadn’t really known stress until that moment in my life.

My path for the next 2 years had been bulldozed. I had nothing else to look forward to.

Around that time, I began to notice when I went to bed it wasn’t just my thoughts that were keeping me awake - it was also this weird urge to kick my legs, to move, to get out of bed and walk around, jump, stretch. Night after night I would get frustrated and wildly kick at my blankets - I’m pretty sure there was some screaming as  well.

On a routine visit with my doctor after months of sleepless nights, she asked if there was anything else she could help me with. 

  “Well, I feel a little crazy bringing this up, but when I go to bed at night, I get this creepy, crawly feeling in my legs. Like I have to move them or get out of bed entirely and walk around.”

I fully expected her to look at me sideways and ask me nicely to leave, but after a few more questions she diagnosed me with something called Restless Legs Syndrome.

A DIAGNOSIS! That meant there was a treatment, right?! Unfortunately, no. At that time her best suggestion was to try to better manage my stress.

A few days later I got a call from the school I had applied to - a spot had opened up and I was next on the waitlist if I wanted it. I had 4 weeks to secure tuition money, pack up my life and move to another province before classes started. So much for managing my stress!

In the 15 years since, I’ve done a lot of personal research and have tried many a home remedy. Some work, some don’t. What worked last night, may not work tonight. What works for me, may not work for you.

What I HAVE learned, is that there is always more to learn, and I want Well Rested to be a place we can all come to learn, share, question and cope!

Here's hoping for restful legs!
