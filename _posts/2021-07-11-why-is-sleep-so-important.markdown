excerpt: "Why is good quality sleep the key to being Well Rested?"
---
We‚Äôve talked about the discomfort that Restless Legs Syndrome causes, but the real concern is that it can rob you of good quality sleep, and lead to sleep deprivation. 

Why does this matter? How important is a full night‚Äôs sleep anyway? What IS a ‚Äúfull‚Äù night‚Äôs sleep? Let‚Äôs try to answer those questions.

A recently published position statement from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine states that ‚Äúsleep is a biological necessity, and insufficient sleep and untreated sleep disorders are detrimental for health, well-being, and public safety.‚Äù

AASM President Dr. Kannan Ramar has said, ‚ÄúHealthy sleep is as important as proper nutrition and regular exercise for our health and well-being, and sleep is critical for performance and safety. It is the position of the AASM that sleep is essential to health, and we are urging educators, health care professionals, government agencies, and employers to prioritize the promotion of healthy sleep.‚Äù

According to the authors, healthy sleep is important for:
- cognitive functioning
- mood 
- mental health
- cardiovascular health
- cerebrovascular health
- metabolic health

Thankfully, this AASM position statement not only discusses the importance of better sleep, it stresses the need for better education, future research and public health initiatives.

It also highlights that multiple sleep related objectives are included in Healthy People 2030 - an initiative by the U.S Department of Health and Human Services to improve the health and well being of their citizens over the next decade with data driven objectives.

**But What IS Sleep?**

Sleep is a body process controlled by nerve signaling chemicals. These chemicals determine when we sleep and wake by sending signals to different parts of the brain and brainstem. They trigger these areas to turn on and switch off other chemicals that tell the brain to keep us awake.

There are 5 phases of sleep: Stage 1, 2, 3, 4 and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep.

Stage 1 sleep is just as it sounds. You are just starting to drift off. It‚Äôs easy to be woken up. Eye movement slows as you begin to relax. Some people may experience limb twitching (PLMS) in this stage. Ever wake up with a jolt after feeling like you‚Äôre falling? This was likely during stage 1 sleep.

Stage 2 sleep is when the slow down really starts. Eye movement stops and brain waves slow down.

Stage 3 and Stage 4 sleep is what we consider ‚Äúdeep sleep‚Äù. Delta (extremely slow) brain waves are present and there is no eye movement or muscle activity. Have you woken someone up to not know where they are or can‚Äôt make sense of what is happening? You likely woke them from one of these stages.

Rapid Eye Movement or REM sleep is fascinating - it‚Äôs got a lot going on. This is the phase of sleep where the dreaming happens. It's the ‚Äúactive‚Äù phase of sleep: heart rate increases, breathing pattern changes, blood pressure may rise and of course, the eyes jerk rapidly in various directions.

Research is showing that REM sleep is important to learning and retaining new information and skills. The brain regions used in learning are the same regions stimulated by REM sleep. Babies tend to spend more time in this phase of sleep than adults, which would make sense for brain development. 

These 5 phases of sleep occur on a cycle: 1, 2, 3, 4, REM - repeat. 

The amount of time you spend in each phase varies, but the whole cycle generally lasts 90 - 110 minutes, then you begin again! 

**How Much Sleep Do We Need?**

The amount of sleep time people need varies, but for adults the AASM recommends 7 hours or more. It can be a process to determine what is right for you, and the magic number may change throughout your life with things like pregnancy or age. 

The term sleep deprivation is thrown around alot, but it simply means that an individual did not get enough good quality sleep. While movie style torture of keeping people awake for days on end is technically sleep deprivation, it does not have to be as extreme as that to have negative health consequenses. 

**Why is Sleep So Important?**

Again, the position statement states, ‚ÄúIt is the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) that sleep is essential to health.‚Äù

Cognitive functioning, mood, mental health, and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and metabolic health are all impacted by sleep. 

Without good quality sleep, you may begin to feel drowsy and have trouble with memory and concentration. 

We‚Äôve all felt that ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù. 

Poor quality sleep may increase mood swings (personally guilty üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and make emotional and social functioning more difficult. The areas of the brain responsible for these functions rest during deep sleep (makes sense); which may explain why our fuses are shorter when we don‚Äôt give them a chance to recover.

Sleep is also linked to your immune system. Ever wondered why when you get sick, all you want to do is sleep? When you are sick, the chemicals your body uses to fight infection (cytokines) are also sleep-inducing. The body triggers sleep to heal itself.

Something else to consider? Adequate sleep has recently been highly linked to a decreased risk of heart disease. Getting the right amount of sleep can help keep your heart healthy.

Honestly, I could go on and on. There are numerous ways poor sleep can negatively impact your life. 

The most drastic? The length. 
Studies have shown that people who get too little quality sleep will not live as long as those who manage to get the recommended amount.

I‚Äôve just skimmed the surface of the ways sleep affects our daily functioning to give context into why managing the symptoms of restless legs syndrome is important. If you‚Äôd like me to address one or more of the topics mentioned in depth, comment below and I‚Äôd be happy to look at it in a future post!

But really, you need to speak with your doctor. In the next post we‚Äôll discuss what to expect when talking to your doctor if you think the symptoms of restless legs syndrome might be impacting your ability to get a good night‚Äôs sleep.
