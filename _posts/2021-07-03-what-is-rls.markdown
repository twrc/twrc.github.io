excerpt: "Why do I have the urge to move my legs at night?"
---

<ins>*Restless Legs Syndrome*</ins> (RLS) is a medical condition also known as Willis-Ekbom disease.

Depending on what you read/where you get your information, you may find something new each time you search ‚Äúrestless legs syndrome‚Äù.  I will do my best to outline the basics of what RLS is, though information is constantly changing (which, in my opinion, is a good thing).

RLS has been considered a sleep disorder, a neurological disorder and a movement disorder.

It causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs ‚Äì making a person feel like they need to change positions, kick, stretch or walk around. 

For most people these sensations show up at night when settling into bed, and the urge to move is relentless (and quite annoying). 

These sensations can be:
- Aching
- Crawling
- Electric‚Äìshock like
- Itching
- Pulling
- Throbbing

This is not your typical muscle-cramping or ‚Äúmy foot fell asleep‚Äù tingling. 

RLS sensations are difficult for people to describe, but the common thread is that they stop with movement ‚Äì stretching, walking, shaking (though they may come back once movement stops).

As I said, these sensations most commonly flare up at night, however some unlucky people may feel them after a long period of rest. Think long car or plane rides or sitting to watch a movie.

Most people will feel this discomfort in their legs, but a small number may feel the same in their arms.

To add to all this, many people with RLS will also experience a condition called periodic limb movement of sleep (PLMS), which causes their legs to move or twitch involuntarily while they sleep.

*These sensations in themselves are not dangerous.*

The potential concern comes from the effect the symptoms of RLS can have on sleep. The uncomfortable, irritating and sometimes painful symptoms will make falling and staying asleep very difficult. 

The importance of sleep and being ‚ÄúWell Rested‚Äù üòâ is widely known. Sleep deprivation can affect concentration, mood, memory, work productivity and can contribute to depression and anxiety - along with a laundry list of other concerns.

<ins>*My Experience:*</ins>

I am one of the (un)lucky people who experiences these sensations when trying to go to sleep at night AND after sitting for longer periods of time ü•≥. 

Long plane rides can be pretty uncomfortable and I‚Äôve been known to get up and walk the aisles. I‚Äôm also a chronic leg shaker ‚Äì you know the kind, bouncing one leg while sitting without even realizing it.

The sensations I feel most commonly I would describe as ‚Äúcrawling‚Äù and the urge to move, with ‚Äúitching‚Äù as a close second. I also get ‚Äúpulling‚Äù that only occurs at night and will ease if I get out of bed to stretch or massage my legs. My symptoms thankfully are just in my legs, I haven‚Äôt felt them in my arms.

I also have the pleasure of PLMS and have been told I twitch and sometimes rock in my sleep - I‚Äôm not sure if the rocking is caused by PLMS, or if it is just another fun sleep movement. 

Luckily my dog (who lets me sleep in her bed) doesn‚Äôt seem to mind too much.

This combination of RLS, PLMS and possibly unrelated random rocking, means I rarely get a good quality full night‚Äôs sleep. 

Guys, I‚Äôm always tired. For years I‚Äôve been chasing that Well Rested feeling. Writing this blog doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve got it all figured out, but it gives me a place to intentionally work to improve my sleep (and life).

I‚Äôm hoping it can also give you some tips to manage your own symptoms and inspires you to share your experiences with me and this community ü§ó.
