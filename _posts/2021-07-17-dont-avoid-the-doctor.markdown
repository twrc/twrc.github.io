excerpt: "Prolonged poor sleep is not ok. Don’t be afraid to talk to your doctor if your sleep is suffering for any reason."

Sure it sounds pretty self explanatory, but the symptoms of restless legs can be tough to explain to someone who has never felt the aggravation. It can also be difficult for the person experiencing it to understand what is happening if they have never heard the term [“Restless Legs Syndrome”](/blog/what-is-rls/).

A lot of people think they won’t be understood or believed, and many don’t bring it up with their health care provider out of fear of the dreaded “it’s all in your head”.

Trust me, it’s not.

If you haven’t learned yet: [“poor sleep is not ok"](/blog/why-is-sleep-so-important/). (Link to Sleep post) If you are experiencing anything that is affecting your sleep long term, PLEASE chat with a doctor or healthcare provider.

**What can I expect?**

There is no invasive testing to diagnose restless leg syndrome. In fact, there is no specific test at all. A diagnosis is made by a doctor’s assessment and the most discomfort you may feel is in answering some questions.

Be prepared to go through an in-depth summary of your symptoms and sleep history ([use our free Sleep log PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twrc/twrc.github.io/main/assets/posts/HabitTracker.pdf) to summarize) and to review your medical and family history (if that information is available to you).

Features a doctor will look for, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke are:

- A strong and often overwhelming need or urge to move the legs, that is often associated with abnormal, unpleasant, or uncomfortable sensations.
- The urge to move the legs starts or get worse during rest or inactivity.
- The urge to move the legs is at least temporarily and partially or totally relieved by movements. 
- The urge to move the legs starts or is aggravated in the evening or night.
- The above four features are not due to any other medical or behavioral condition.

It would also be helpful to bring a list of any medications and nutritional supplements you are currently taking. You can add these to the “notes” section of our Sleep Log.

Your doctor may perform a physical exam, a neurological exam and possibly recommend some lab tests – to rule out other causes of your symptoms.

While often not required, your doctor may refer you to a specialist for a sleep study to see if you are experiencing any other sleep disorder (for example: sleep apnea).

**What does a diagnosis mean?**

Don’t panic, but unfortunately there is no cure for RLS and for most people it is a lifelong condition. 

There are therapies and strategies to manage symptoms and improve sleep and we will talk about these in depth in future posts – stay tuned!!
Some people will experience periods of remission when symptoms go away completely for a time.

A diagnosis does not mean you will develop another neurological condition later in life. While it is true that people with a neurological condition (think – Parkinson’s Disease) may also develop RLS, having RLS does not mean you will develop Parkinson’s Disease. This was a personal fear of mine.

***My Experience:***

See the [My Story](/blog/my-story/) post for how I was diagnosed. I had never heard of restless legs syndrome  and felt “crazy” bringing it up, but thankfully I had an understanding and caring doctor who listened, reassured and validated me.
