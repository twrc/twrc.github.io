WELCOME! I hope youâ€™re not finding this at 3 am because you canâ€™t sleep - but hopefully now that you have, we can make late night web surfing a thing of the past!!

My name is Katie and Iâ€™m a healthcare worker of the millennial generation. In 2006 I was diagnosed with Restless Legs Syndrome and Iâ€™ve been tossing and turning ever since ðŸ˜‰.

As someone with a medical background, Iâ€™ve searched for explanations and treatments and longed for answers to this diagnosis that was quite literally keeping me up at night (note: I am NOT a doctor, and this blog is not to provide medical advice).

SO â€“ Iâ€™ve started this site as a place for others dealing with Restless Leg Syndrome to come to get information, support, coping strategies, etc. Hopefully we can build a WELL RESTED community!
